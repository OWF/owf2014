##TAKE BACK CONTROL
The program is built around " Take back control ". It's aim is to show that the Free and the Open source can help (re)take control on its IT/IS and not to be allowed to be dominated by the non-free solutions, whether it is professionally or in your personal life. Instead of losing control gradually, the use of the FLOSS allows to gain in technological, legal and financial independence.


##MULTIPLE CHALLENGES
The event does not only concern players of the Free and the Open source communities but is an important meeting of the of the digital technologyâ€™s community. The program is rich and discusses, among others themes, Cloud computing, Big Data and Open Data, the Software Quality and also education and training, which were real achievements during the previous editions. This edition will also be an occasion to introduce new themes highlighted and close to the current events: Security,  Privacy, Embedded systems but also mobility with mobile systems like Firefox bone, Ubuntu Touch or Android.


This event is a beautiful opportunity to meet and exchange with different players of Open source, in France and internationally.
