title: About The Open World Forum

## A Unique Event

The Open World Forum is the first European summit to gather political representatives, decision-makers and experts, in one place, in order to debate the technological, economic and social impacts that the Free and Open-Source technologies bring to market. The forum was first held in 2008, and is now organized annually in Paris, France, with more than 200 speakers coming from 40 countries, and a global audience that was 2100-people strong in 2012.
