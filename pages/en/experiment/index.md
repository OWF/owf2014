title: EXPERIMENT - An Open World for Citizens


### Data collection, knowledge sharing, right to oblivion : take back control !


Fully in line with the theme of the Open World Forum 2014 "Take Back Control", EXPERIMENT 2014 will present the new societal challenges of today citizens. In front of a system which sometimes overtakes him, the citizen must be able to hold keys to regain control over his omnipresent digital life and personal data. To ensure this, he must be able to understand and thus learn. This is the stake of EXPERIMENT 2014. Based on a renewed dynamic of exchanges and knowledge sharing, that we will offer you  to study in depth questions of personal and open data.


**EXPERIMENT 2014:  three highlights**


This day will be led by conferences and workshops aimed at the citizen but also professionals concerned by societal stakes: from data collection to knowledge sharing. Takeover by the citizen on its own data and the open data will be part of bigger themes we will develop during this day. A round table on **the right to oblivion** as well as workshops led by Free and Open communities (including software and hardware) specialized in knowledge sharing will allow everyone to deepen and to widen topics on how to take back control. 


A permanent exhibition will demonstrate the use of connected objects (IoT) targeting citizens, professionals  or individuals. Purpose of this exhibition is to show the overflowing and unlimited innovation of French and European companies in this new innovation sector. A contest for the most interesting connected object (IoT) will also be proposed. Competition will end with an Award ceremony with 3 differents prizes: Citizen, Enterprise and Kid.


The Free software, Open Hardware and Open Source communities will be at your disposal in our exhibition hall. Children are encouraged to try out at will and actively participate during the day. A dedicated program has been set up for them. **Playful and educational** animations around knowledge sharing will be proposed for youngster as well as for grown up.
