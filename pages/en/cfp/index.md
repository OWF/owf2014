## Take Back Control !

Open World Forum is back for a wholly new edition ! It will occur this year on October 30th, 31th and November 1st. Last year's edition was a big success, and we are looking forward to another event with even more talks, more workshops, and more social networking. We need you to make this happen! We encourage you to submit a talk if you have a great story to tell on any of the following topics. 
Presentations purely promoting a product, solution or a company will not be accepted.

This year's program will show you how to take back control of your digital world, including IT/IS and (personal) data, whether you are a professional or not.  Stop losing control and discover how Free and Open Source software may help you be more and more independent, whether technologically, legally or financially.

Classic and essential subjects as Cloud computing, Data, Internet of Things, Dev, etc. will be treated from a user's needs' point of view. We will also put a strong emphasis on trending topics : Security, Privacy, Trust and Mobility.

Please submit your proposal for subjects, talks, lectures or participation in panel discussions on one of the following subjects. The topics are grouped into three general categories.

Thematics
If you aren’t sure which Track is the best fit for your submission, just take a best guess and the program committee may change it later. There’s no “wrong” type of submission and we want the conference to be appealing to a large audience. If you think your topic is interesting, there’s a good chance the program committee will too! We will also try to record much more talks than before to be available to a connected audience. Standard presentation duration is 35 minutes, including questions. We have designed this year's edition to maximize the opportunity to meet other attendees, visit the sponsors and get updated on what the community is doing. The program organization is simple. All talks are 35 minutes long, scheduled into a 45-minute time slot. Please note that the conference language will have to be mostly in English with a few part in French.

### Think

THINK will be held over the course of the first two days, and will outline the major role of Openness (Free and Open-Source Software, Open Data, Open Hardware, Open Design, etc.) in the digital society. It will show you how it can help you manage "Degrees of Freedom", find unsuspected resources, regain trust, security and independence, setup a virtuousVRM (Vendor Relationship Management), etc.
