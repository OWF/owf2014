title: 'A word from the #OWF14 President'
date: 2014/11/06


This edition definitely achieved to convince me and my team of VPs of one thing : the Open World Forum is unique and amazing. Our “**Take Back Control**” motto established an obvious link between the various topics, whether  it’s Big Data, Open Data, Embedded, Internet of Things, Cloud computing, DevOps, Privacy, Security or all others. We proved that Free and Open Source software is leading innovation in nearly all the themes we developed. Targeting both enterprises and the civil society.


Even if we are expecting your feedback, it seems that the overall opinion was pretty positive. Every year is better than the previous one and apparently, the conferences quality raised up again this year. If I had to speak about my own experience, I would mention the following moments:

- Experimenting myself how to recover different kinds of data such as air and sea traffic or weather forecasts during an intense Internet of Things session
- Discovering concrete example showing that Open Source technologies have now as good results as proprietary ones in the Security track, a lot about Sec Dev.
- Finding out with all of the Privacy participants, that our open source solutions were way past the prototype phases, ready to be used!
- Being a part of the awareness raise amongst the students and youngster population
- Discussing Star Wars with the InMove robot and dancing with Poppy, almost as I’ve met C3PO twins !


One year of hard work, but I've been rewarded a thousand times : I have learned a lot, I have met very interesting people and above all I have been enjoying myself and I hope you share the same feelings :-)


**Thanks to all of you,
Florent ZARA, Open World Forum 2014 President**
