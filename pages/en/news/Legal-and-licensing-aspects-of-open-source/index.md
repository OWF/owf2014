## Legal and licensing aspects of Open Source


### Open Source allows you to take back control  


Open source licenses give you a lot of freedoms and powers, although they also come with some obligations. 
Still poorly understood or misunderstood, they are nevertheless essential to maintaining an open and collaborative 
system balanced. A constant outreach and popularization is necessary to ensure that the Open Source meets these promises
to users while respecting the rights of contributors and editors.


This track considers various legal and licensing aspects of open source, both from a community and a corporate perspective.
The track is a great opportunity for you to discuss legal and licensing aspects of open source with lawyers, decision makers,
open source developers and other people who are interested in legal aspects of open source.  
Come and discuss how open source licenses have helped you take back control and what legal issues you've encountered 
when adopting or contributing to open source.


This track will stand **31th of October**, possible topics include: Contribution policies, Contributor License Agreement (CLAs),
Legal issues and the cloud, Open source and contracts, Open source and standards & Compliance processes.
