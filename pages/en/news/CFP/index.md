title: Call for Participation
date: 2013/06/01

The Open World Forum is the first European summit to gather political representatives, decision-makers and experts to debate the technological, economic and social impacts that the Free and Open-Source technologies bring to the market. The forum was first held in 2008, and is now organized annually in Paris, France, with more than 200 speakers coming from 24 countries, and a global audience that was 2100-people strong in 2012. The Open World Forum is held in partnership with all the major international communities in Free Software and with the key players in the digital economy.

The Open World Forum is back for its sixth edition. It will occur on the 3rd, 4th and 5th of October 2013, and will take place in a completely new setting in order to accommodate a larger audience. This edition will be a milestone on the way to becoming the premier global event bringing together state policies, social concerns, technology and economy. OWF will take place at the Beffroi in Paris, France and will again be organized by Systematic Paris Region. More than 3,000 attendees are expected for this next Edition, reflecting the renovated program.

Please submit your proposal for subjects, talks, lectures or participation in panel discussions on one of the following subjects. The submission deadline is set for June 30th, 2013. Submissions will be handled on an ongoing basis.

## 2013 Themes

### THINK: *Make it Happen!*

THINK will be held over the course of the two first days, and will outline the major role of Free and Open-Source Software in the digital economy. The "Make it Happen!" baseline sums up the focus on building a successful free and open-source strategy, from a technological and commercial standpoint.

The opening day format will differ from the previous editions as talks will happen in a single-track schedule in the largest auditorium. This enables us to concentrate on having the best schedule in a unique plenary session, dedicated to decision-makers in the private and public sectors. Talks will be more concise and will be followed byt the Think tanks and workshops that will be held on the second day.

This renewed format will support the 2013 focus: making it happen. The Free and Open- Source Software industry is now at a point where we need to have IT departments take the step from intention, either from strategy or political decision, to actual use or purchase.

We will demonstrate that innovation is carried by Free and Open-Source Software, and is now therefore accessible to all companies and administrations. It is nowadays easier to innovate in each market because of the availability of free and innovative technologies. This demystification of practical innovation will be the major theme of this sixth edition of the Open World Forum.
