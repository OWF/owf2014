**Open Innovation** disrupts the traditional conception of innovation by establishing the idea of a social innovation 
where the aim is no longer to create first but to have better designs and more inventions with the help of others.  


Transposed to technologic industry, this brand new paradigm makes the explosive growth of open source software
possible by being its economic support. Formerly limited to a handful of developers, Open Source is nowaday a wide
ecosystem in which big Companies, SMEs, searchers and entrepreneurs work together to create a faster, stronger, 
safer and more collaborative innovation.   


While **Open Source success stories** are being revealed, in France and elsewhere, big players are adopting open, 
collective and collaborative innovation model. Moreover, the development of both vertical or horizontal partnerships 
helps create a virtuous collective dynamics for the profit of these common objectives, in the context of an ecosystem 
combining values from sharing & innovation.


Through the testimonials of various stakeholders, the track **"Innovation and Open Source"** will provide an overview of
these new synergies & collaborations made possible by the Open Source, either through alliances between startups, 
large accounts and research centers. Their experiences will convince everyone of the benefits gained from 
the **Open Source** model as a driver of technological innovation.
