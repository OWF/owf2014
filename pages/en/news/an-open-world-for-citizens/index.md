**THINK** will be the occasion to understand how the innovation's and openness' combination could be as much as a solution to the issues from the past as the factor for success for the future stakes. Therefore, this model will be presented in its valuation side, from both private and public sector innovations. This following article is part of a bundle of short analyzes that will be published to illustrate the various topics discussed within **THINK theme during the 2014 edition**.


### Open Access: for an Open and accessible to all Research ?

*"Open Access is still the dream to pursue, [but] it must be accompanied by the necessary measures to avoid its current drifts"* [1]


Completely free access to knowledge at early stage and unrestricted (re)use of research results : this is the ambition of « Open Access » advocates. Promoted as the necessary and evident consequence of Internet & our new information society, promoted by community initiatives, formalized by researchers during the Budapest Open Access Initiative, the concept had finally permeated policies, in particular at a European level. Taking widely over the content of the BOAI 10 and in accordance with objectives stated in the “Europe 2020” strategy, the European Commission insisted on its recommendations of July 17th 2012 on the necessity to make publicly founded research freely accessible, immediately or very shortly after it has been published.


There are several benefits: reduction of duplicated effort, limitation of the time spend on information research, facilitation of researchers cooperation, improvement of innovation quality, relevance, acceptance and durability... where the current system impedes research and innovation by limiting  knowledge spreading.


Nevertheless, Open Access movement is challenged in many way and struggle to find its definition and tools. First of all, its development is slow down by the predatory strategy of some companies which intend to benefit from the movement whereas their behavior tarnish its the reputation and questioned the quality of the research it generates. At the same tame, this impetus for change born in reaction to the harnessing of scientific articles by a restraint number of private editors is held up by opportunist practices of those traditional stakeholders which remain impervious (blind ?) to its values.


Take some time to think about Open Acess implementation is essential to its recognition as a credible alternative model. The **THINK** thematic of OWF would bring the opportunity to find some answers to recurrent and primordial questions such as Open Access appropriate business model(s), infrastructures and legal instruments available and/or those to create and implement (licenses, libraries, …), strategic and governance aspects into research center, peer-reviewed process or research data and metadata ownership.
