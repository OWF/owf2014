title:Open Law
date:2014/09/11

Open Law is a "legal co-creation program" organized by the OWF, DILA, Etalab and NUMA launched Friday, October 31 at the OWF. It relies on Open Data datasets recently released in France and aims to stimulate and promote the reuse of legal data within a collaborative and open legal innovation that brings together the public and private sector.

The main objectives of this programme are:
* to think on the usages, practices and r√¥le surrounding the law in our digital society;
* to increase the accessibility of newly released legal information Open Data datasets ; 
* to built a community of "hackers of law"
* conduct experiments around the legal framework for this type of event.

It is intended to be fed for an entire year through a multitude of periodic events for deepening, prefigure and prototype individual projects.
