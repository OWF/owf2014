###John Sullivan at #OWF13 for GNU's 30th anniversary! 

On September 27th 1983, Richard Stallman annouced the launch of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.en.html" target="_blank">GNU Project</a>. 
To celebrate this anniversary at the Open World Forum, we are happy to welcome John Sullivan, Executive Director of Free 
Software Foundation, for a Keynote intervention. He will also introduce the cloud track. John Sullivan was invited by the 
<a href="http://www.april.org/" target="_blank">April association</a>.

John started working with GNU Press and the Free Software Foundation in 2003 and then became the FSF's first Campaigns 
Manager, working on outreach efforts like Defective by Design, BadVista, and PlayOgg. In 2011, John became the Executive 
Director after four years as Manager of Operations.

His background is mainly in the humanities, with an MFA in Writing and Poetics and a BA in Philosophy, but he has been 
spending too much time with computers and online communities since the days of the Commodore 64. He became a dedicated 
GNU Emacs user after first trying it out in 1996, and contributes code to several of its extensions.

Prior to the FSF, John worked as a college debate team instructor for both Harvard and Michigan State University.

###THINK - Purchasing Strategies and Open Source 

Buyer, friends or enemies of Open Source?

Buyers are now major players in the choices that companies and public entities make in the IT department. 
One of their main missions is to make quick discounts in the purchasing budget. Negotiating and justifying  
the cost of a license is easier than  justifying completely overhauling  the spending scheme (license vs. service) as 
the  transition to open software is more complex. How do IT directors and buyers choose between these options? Should 
there be a specific purchasing approach and a different dialogue with the IT departments concerning open software.

###CODE - Focus on the Big Data session

Data technologies are changing fast and with them, the technology landscape is also changing in a big way. They are, 
according to Systematic Paris-Region's Working Group on free and open source software a major challenge, from both 
technical and business points of view and a major opportunity for open source innovations to make an impact on the 
economy.

This track aims to give at the same time a broad overview on the current state of affairs with big data infrastructures,
analytics, search, machine learning and real time, but also to open future perspectives : how do you handle big data 
over a decade? what is the social and ethical impact it will have?

If you have a big data strategy these talks may give you a new perspective, if you don't, you might very well learn 
where you are supposed to start.
