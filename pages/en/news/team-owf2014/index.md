Open World Forum is back for a whole new edition! It will occur on October 30th, 31th and November 1st.

Last year's edition was a big success, and we are looking forward to another event with even more talks, more workshops, and more social networking.

This year's program will show you how to take back control of your digital world, including IT/IS and data, professional or not. Stop losing control and discover how Free and Open Source software may help you be more and more independent technologically, legally or financially.

The President of the Open World Forum, Florent ZARA, is pleased to introduce you the Vice-Presidents for this edition.
