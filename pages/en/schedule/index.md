title: Schedule

###Thursday, October 3rd

The **opening day** format will differ from the previous editions as talks will happen in a **single-track schedule** in the largest auditorium. This enables us to concentrate on having the best schedule in a unique plenary session, dedicated to decision-makers in the private and public sectors. Talks will be more concise and will introduce the **think tanks and workshops** that will be held on the **second day**.

This renewed format will support the 2013 motto: **Make It Happen!**. The FLOSS industry is now at a point where we need to have IT departments take the **step from intention**, either in strategy or political decision, to **actual use or purchase**.

We will demonstrate that **innovation with FLOSS** is accessible to **all companies and organisations**. It is nowadays easier to innovate in each market because of the availability of free and innovative technologies. This **demystifcation of practical innovation** will be the major theme of this sixth edition of the Open World Forum


###Friday, October 4th

The **THINK** theme will be explored deeper during the second day, **through workshops and think tanks** led by industry and community leaders. This will enable attendees to contribute to the **evolution of our field**, and of course, provide the meeting point where the **world experts** will get together and talk about the present and the future.


In the same time we will launch the **CODE** Theme. The focus will be on the following
topics: Web, Infrastructure (Cloud, but not exclusively), Data and Mobility. The Web, especially with the user aspects, like the **UX** movement and the **Responsive Design** requirements, but also **accessibility**, a topic that will be increasingly important in the future.


### Saturday, October 5th

**CODE** will continue during the third day as well.

Saturday is **EXPERIMENT** day, addressed to novices as well as to professionals that are concerned with social issues: beginning with **artistic creation** all the way to **democracy** and interconnected objects, the topics addressed by the Free and Open Source will allow us to further our understanding in these areas but just as well to apply them in real life.

**Children** are most welcome to test and participate, with a special schedule dedicated to them: KIDEXPERIMENT. There will be a number of **discovery workshops** for various free or open source software and hardware as well as **mini-conferences** for young people on the topics of democracy and free art.
