title:  THINK - Make It Happen!

THINK will take place over the course of the two first days, and will outline the major role of FLOSS in the digital economy. The “<b>Make it Happen!</b>” baseline **very concretely** sums up the focus on building a successful free and open-source strategy, from a technological and commercial standpoint.

The **opening day** format will differ from the previous editions as talks will happen in a **single-track schedule** in the largest auditorium. This enables us to concentrate on having the best schedule in a unique plenary session dedicated to decision-makers in the private and public sectors. Talks will be more concise and will introduce the **think tanks and workshops**  held on the **second day**.

This renewed format will support the 2013 focus: **making it happen**. The FLOSS industry is now at a point where we need to have IT departments **take the step from intention**, either from strategy or political decision, **to actual use or purchase**.

We will demonstrate that **innovation** with FLOSS is accessible **to all companies and organisations**. It is nowadays easier to innovate in each market because of the availability of free and innovative technologies. **This demystification of practical innovation** will be the major theme of this sixth edition of the Open World Forum.

All of our speakers have **successfully innovated** with free and open-source software and will **share their experiences** around its use and impact. Shared innovation and the platforms available for **collaborative innovation** will be represented. More practically, speakers will document the way they succeeded in bringing innovation through FLOSS in the following sectors:

* Digital economy
* Media
* Education
* Public sector
* Foundations and Communities


The **opening day** will be dedicated to **keynotes, conferences and panels**. The individual talk slot format will be shorter than previous editions, so we can have a **very dynamic and interesting program**. The morning will be the opportunity to approach **the real impact** of Open-Source in the digital economic world, as well as the impact of **state policies**, the governance, educational and business issues. We'll end this sequence with some **industrial, organizational, community and government success stories** that might inspire attendees to choose Free and Open-Source Software for their next projects.

The afternoon will focus on the innovation catalyst role that Open-Source plays in the major technological and educational projects, especially in **infrastructure** and **Cloud**, in **Big Data** and the **Hadoop** platforms, in the **Web** of tomorrow and in **Mobility**.

**CIOs** and major users of FLOSS will be invited to take part in the fifth edition of the **Open CIO Summit**, which is scheduled for the end of the day.

These topics will be explored deeper **during the second day**, through **workshops and think tanks** led by industry and community leaders. This will enable attendees to contribute to the **evolution of our field**, and of course provide the meeting point where the **world experts** will get together and talk about the present and the future.
