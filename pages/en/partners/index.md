<a name="abilian"><a href="http://www.abilian.com/fr/" target="_blank"><img src="/static/pictures/page sponsor et organisateurs/abilian_page sponsor.png" width="400" alt="abilian"></a></a>

**Abilian** est un éditeur de logiciels open source qui propose des solutions innovantes pour votre entreprise ou
votre organisation, dans les domaines de la collaboration émergente (entreprise 2.0), des processus métiers et de la
gestion de l'information.

Une plateforme de collaboration émergente est l'outil idéal pour partager des informations, communiquer,
collaborer et dynamiser l’activité de votre organisation au quotidien.

Les réseaux sociaux d’entreprises, et autres applications “entreprise 2.0”, connaissent actuellement un engouement
irréfutable. Ainsi, les 3/4 des DRH interrogés par l’Observatoire des DRH et de la e-transformation en 2011
considèrent la mise à disposition d’un réseau social d’entreprise comme nécessaire ou souhaitable. Après la mise à
disposition d’espaces de partage documentaire collaboratif, c’est la deuxième priorité pour ces mêmes DRH.

Cet engouement s’inscrit dans un contexte général de transformation profonde de la façon dont travaillent les
entreprises à l’aube du 21ème siècle.

<a name="jamendo"><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/" target="_blank"><img src="/static/pictures/page sponsor et organisateurs/jamendo_logo.png" alt="jamendo"></a></a>

**Jamendo** is a music website and an open community of music authors. It bills itself as "the world's largest digital
service for free music".

Since the beginning in 2005, Jamendo's music has been licensed under Creative Commons licenses. Applied to all songs,
these licenses allow artists to publish their music and preserve their rights while providing users the freedom to
download it for free and redistribute at least noncommercially, with other permissions varying by license. The goal of
Jamendo is to be the link between artists who want to share their music and audiences around the world, both private
and professional.

At the center of Jamendo is an economic model that grants free music downloads for web users, while at the same time
providing revenue opportunities for artists through commercial uses, via the licensing platform Jamendo PRO which
sells licenses for music synchronization and background music.

Based in Luxembourg, the website has a community of 1.4 million members.

At the end of 2012, the catalog comprised 362,000 tracks by 30,000 artists from 120 countries. The site is available
in 6 languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian and Polish. The name "Jamendo" is derived from a fusion of
two musical terms: "jam session" and "crescendo".

<a name="palamida"><a href="http://www.palamida.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/static/pictures/page sponsor et organisateurs/palamida_logo.jpg" width="400" alt="palamida"></a></a>

Palamida delivers software and services for open source compliance that provide unique visibility into what makes up a 
software development project, enabling you to effectively manage and secure your use of Open Source and other 
third-party code.

We enable organizations to use and reuse code from many sources - and do so while reducing the risk of license 
violations, software vulnerabilities and export control violations. Our patented code search technology scans source 
and binary materials and produces an inventory of software components used – a software bill of materials – and flags 
issues that are exceptions to your policy.

<a name="stackoverlfow"><a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/static/pictures/page sponsor et organisateurs/stackoverflow careers20-logo.png" width="400" alt="stackoverflow"></a></a>

In 2008, Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood created a site called **Stack Overﬂow** and brought together millions of computer
programmers from around the world to help each other with detailed technical questions. That site was a phenomenal
success, so, after securing a $6 million investment from Union Square Ventures, they created the Stack Exchange
Network and launched new sites in August of 2010. In March of 2011, Stack Overﬂow ofﬁcially became Stack Exchange,
cementing the forward growth with an additional $12 million investment by USV as well as Spark Capital and Index
Ventures. There are now more than 100 sites and more than 33 million unique visitors—and we’re still growing!  

Just as Web 2.0 was the concept to reinvent the Internet, Careers 2.0 is our own way of reinventing the hiring process
by connecting programmers with employers through our job board and candidate search. In 2011, Evans Data reported
that the global population of developers is expected to grow from 16 million to 20 million by 2015. Despite this growth,
there are still more open jobs than available programmers. Dice calculated that there were about two or three open jobs
for every 2011 computer science grad and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that the number of developer jobs
will increase 30% by 2020. Careers 2.0 fosters the intersection of this community by bringing employers inside of the
largest online talent pool of programmers.
